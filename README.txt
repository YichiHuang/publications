****************************************************************************************
*2013.5-2014.5  I took part in the College Student Innovation Project which is *held by Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications(BUPT). I was leader *of national project named ¡°Research on Synchronization Algorithm of *Coherent Optical Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiplexing System¡±, under *the supervision of Pro. Xiaoguang Zhang from the Institute of information *Photonics and Optical Communications, BUPT.
*We finished a paper: Research on timing synchronization algorithm of coherent *optical OFDM systems.
*It was published on Acta Optica Sinica Supplement(¹âÑ§Ñ§±¨Ôö¿¯, EI), impact *factor :1.620 (in 2010).
